                <p> My experience as the TA for one of Seattle Central's CS 143 classes strengthened my effectiveness in communication and explaining learning topics. This also meant adapting to their learning styles, allowing for a more approachable learning experience. During this time, I organized a slack, hosted study sessions, and created practice worksheets for students.</p>

                <p> As a project leader for EcoRep's Making the Ave Greener project, I helped with researching sustainability in businesses and conducting a survey of businesses on the ave. Using an informational pamphlet, we contacted several restaurants and have begun working to make their restaurants more sustainable.</p>

                <p> During my time at the VA Medical Center, I was a volunteer for their IT department. I primarily assisted their team with installing new desktops for hospital employees. This experience taught me how vital information technology is for professionals in other fields and showed me the teamwork that exists between different departments.</p>
