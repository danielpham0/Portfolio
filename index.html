                    <h1> Daniel Pham </h1>
                    <p> I am currently a student at the University of Washington, intending to major in Informatics or HCDE with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer.
                    <br> 
                    I would like to work on a project related education or sustainability, however I would be happy working in any company that prioritizes the social implications of their technology and utilizes value sensitive design. <br>
                    My values as a team member are built on three pillars - dedication, adaptability and empathy.

                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
                    <p> Welcome to my personal portfolio! 
                        <br>
                        My goal with this website is to serve as a live detailing of the different experiences and projects that I have worked on, and it will continue to be updated as I develop as an engineer. 
                        <br>
                        This website will continue to be updated to include new features as I learn them, whether that is to improve accessibility or interactivity. At this point in time, I have two main goals:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li> Use GitHub and AWS to host this website.</li>
                            <li>Implement JavaScript to animate elements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> My experiences thus far have been related to the practice of informatics and engineering, however I hope to spend the next couple of quarters working in research groups and internships to earn hands-on experience. 
                    <br>
                    In the upcoming quarter, I hope to review python well enough to pursue a personal project, which I will include in the projects tab. 
                    </p>
